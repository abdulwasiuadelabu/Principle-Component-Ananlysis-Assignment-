Principal Component Analysis
Milestone 2 Assignment



PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify essential variables for securing donor funding at the Anderson Cancer Center.
The dataset is sourced from sklearn.datasets (Breast Cancer Data). As an optional step, logistic regression is used to predict cancer classifications.

FILES INCLUDED:
- PCA.ipynb -> Contains the main code for PCA and logistic regression.
- README.txt -> Provides instructions for using this script.


REQUIREMENTS:
- Python
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn

EXECUTION STEPS:
1. Loading the breast cancer dataset.
2. Performing standard scaling on the dataset.
3. Applying PCA to reduce dimensions to 2 principal components.
4. Visualizing PCA results using a scatter plot.
5. Implementing logistic regression for classification.
6. Evaluating the model using accuracy and a classification report.

COMMANDS TO RUN:
Simply execute the PCA.ipynb script:
